# basic_app_neural_networks
At the end of the course, I was told to create a neural network (using MLP, CNN architectures), in which I create a classifying model whether an Alien (a creature from a series of sf films initiated by Ridley Scott's film *Aliens. The Eighth Passenger of Nostromo)* or a Predator (a creature from a series initiated by successful films *) appears in the photo Predator 1* and *Predator 2*).
I also created a basic flask app in which you upload an image and it tells you if its an alien or a predator
